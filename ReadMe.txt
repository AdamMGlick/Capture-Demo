Unity In A Nutshell
------------------------
Unity is a cross platform game engine with scripting in C#. A game made with Unity will have scenes which will each be organized with a hierarchy of GameObjects. GameObjects are the basic container for the elements of a Unity game and have positional information (transform) and scripts (components) for control and manipulation of elements in the game. Unity scripts derive from MonoBehavior, which is the base class for Unity's basic runtime functionality.
